## Description

This is a repository containing both the food-truck backend Nest TS application and the frontend React TS application. I have placed README files in each of the projects respectively
describing how to setup each project and the project structure. Once this repository is cloned each project can be run seperately, the React app consuming the Nest app (which can be started in a docker container). Hope you enjoy them!
